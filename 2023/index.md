# Seventh Workshop on Computer Architecture Research with RISC-V (CARRV 2023)

## Saturday June 17th, 2023, Co-located with [ISCA 2023](https://iscaconf.org/isca2023/)


The Seventh Workshop on RISC-V for Computer Architecture Research (CARRV) seeks original
research papers with a focus on the <b>security of RISC-V cores</b>. However, papers on the design, 
implementation and verification of RISC-V cores, SoCs, and accelerators are also encouraged. 
Submission of early work is encouraged. The topics of specific
interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to:

* RISC-V security
* Security architectures and techniques
* Formal methods
* Verification methodologies
* RISC-V cores and SoC architectures
* RISC-V ISA extensions
* RISC-V-based hardware accelerators
* Hardware/software interfaces
* RISC-V ISA and implementation performance analysis
* RISC-V compilers and dynamic translation tools


## Important Dates

* Early Full paper submission deadline: April 3, 2023, 23:59 PST
* Regular Full paper submission deadline: May 1, 2023, 23:59 PST
* Author notification: TBA
* Camera-ready due: TBA
* Workshop date: June 17, 2023


## Workshop Information

The ISCA 2023 conference organizers have informed us that ISCA 2023,
and the workshops and tutorials, will take place in-person this year.
