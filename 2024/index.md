RISC-V cores, SoCs, and accelerators. The topics of specific
interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to:

* RISC-V cores and SoC architectures
* RISC-V ISA extensions
* RISC-V-based hardware accelerators for AI/ML
* Security architectures and techniques
* Formal methods
* Verification methodologies
* Hardware/software interfaces
* RISC-V ISA and implementation performance analysis
* RISC-V compilers and dynamic translation tools

## Important Dates

* Full paper submission deadline: ~~August 4,~~ August 11,  2024, 23:59 PST
* Author notification: September 1, 2024
* Camera-ready due: September 15, 2024, 23:59 PST
