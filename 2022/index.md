# Sixth Workshop on Computer Architecture Research with RISC-V (CARRV 2022)

## Thursday June 19th, 2022, Co-located with [ISCA 2022](https://iscaconf.org/isca2022/)

The Sixth Workshop on RISC-V for Computer Architecture Research (CARRV) seeks original
research papers on the design, implementation, verification, and security evaluation of RISC-V cores,
SoCs, and accelerators. Submission of early work is encouraged. The topics of specific
interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to:

* RISC-V cores and SoC architectures
* RISC-V security
* RISC-V ISA extensions
* RISC-V-based hardware accelerators
* Security architectures and techniques
* Formal methods
* Verification methodologies
* Hardware/software interfaces
* RISC-V ISA and implementation performance analysis
* RISC-V compilers and dynamic translation tools



## Important Dates

* Full paper submission deadline: May 6, 2022, 23:59 PST
* Author notification: May 13, 2022
* Camera-ready (and video) due: June 3, 2022


## Workshop Information
